                <h5 class="project-h5">Project Description</h5>
                <p>CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning.
              After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually.
              So it has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity.
              Goal is to help in building an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail.</p>

          <h5 class="project-h5">Project Description</h5>
          <p>Employee Attrition is a big issue for the organizations specially when trained, technical and key employees leave for a better opportunity from the organization. This results in financial loss to replace a trained employee. Therefore, we use the current and past employee data to analyze the common reasons for employee attrition or attrition. For the prevention of employee attrition, we applied a well known classification methods, that is, Decision tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Naive bayes methods on the human resource data. For this we implement feature selection method on the data and analysis the results to prevent employee attrition. </p>

            <h5 class="project-h5">Project Description</h5>
            <p>Designed two-player game application where
              players takes turns and joins two dots horizontally or vertically
              by a line.  Player 1 always starts first.

              Players take turns connecting 2 unjoined horizontally or vertically adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and must take another turn.
              
              The game ends when all lines are drawn and boxes are claimed. The player with the most points wins. If more than one player has the same high score, the game is a tie.</p>

            <h5 class="project-h5">Project Description</h5>
            <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, 
              two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, 
              each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, 
              (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts 
              with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, 
              vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
              Goal of this project is to find alive cells based on the
              constraints such as underpopulation, overpopulation,
              reproduction of the neighbor cells.
